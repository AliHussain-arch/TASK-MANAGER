# Task Manager

**Website:** [link](https://task-manager-group-project-frontend.vercel.app/)

The Task Manager application leverages the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node.js—to deliver a seamless project management experience. Upon signing up, users gain access to a secure environment where they can create and manage projects with ease. Each project starts with a title, serving as the foundation for adding tasks. Users can prioritize tasks, mark them as completed, and edit or delete them as project requirements change.

The platform is designed to be intuitive with a clean, responsive interface built using HTML and CSS, ensuring accessibility from any device. The backend, powered by Express and MongoDB, provides robust data handling and secure user authentication, while npm manages dependencies to keep the application modular and maintainable.

Overall, the Task Manager offers a comprehensive solution for individuals and teams looking to organize their work and achieve their goals efficiently.
